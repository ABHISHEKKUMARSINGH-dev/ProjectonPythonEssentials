# Number Theory & Algorithms Collection

A comprehensive set of **34 Python modules** dealing with the properties of integers, prime numbers, cryptographic primitives, and computational number theory; this repository covers topics from basic manipulation of digits up to advanced probabilistic algorithms and discrete mathematics sequences.

Overview ????

This project shows algorithmic skills in Python by paying attention to mathematical rigor, efficiency, and clarity of the code.

**Performance Profiling:** The majority of scripts have automatic `time` and `sys` (or `tracemalloc`) profiling to measure execution speed and memory overhead.

* **Standard Library Only:** All solutions run using native Python libraries (`math`, `time`, `sys`, `random`), ensuring zero external dependencies.

Implementation Highlights & Theory

Chinese Remainder Theorem (File 22)
Crucial for RSA decryption performance optimization. The function solves a system of congruences x = r_i (mod m_i) by constructing the solution using modular inverses of partial products N_i = N/m_i.
```python
def crt(remainders, moduli):
# Calculate N (product of all moduli)
# Solve for x using: sum(r_i * N_i * inverse(N_i, m_i)) % N

y_i = mod_inverse(N_i, m_i)

total += r_i * N_i * y_i

Collatz Conjecture (File 28)

The function here implements the rules of the famous "3n + 1" problem; for any positive integer n, if even, divide by 2, otherwise multiply by 3 and add 1. This function will keep track of the trajectory length or stopping time.

Carmichael Numbers (File 30)

Identifies "pseudoprimes" that foil the Fermat primality test. The function checks first that n is composite, then that a^(n-1) = 1 mod n for all a coprime to n.

Pollard's Rho Algorithm (File 32)


Finds a nontrivial factor of a composite integer n more quickly than trial division, using a randomized function f(x) = x^2 + c (mod n) to find cycles.
